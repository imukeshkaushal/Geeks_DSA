Problem : Palindrome Linked List

Problem Statement : Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a 
palindrome or false otherwise.

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
 

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?v
